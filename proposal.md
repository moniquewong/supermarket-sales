## 1. Motivation and purpose
Customers of supermarkets have a choice in the supermarkets they shop at - competition for the customer's dollars can be intense. As a result, supermarkets use a variety of techniques to lure customers to thier stores. These techniques include varying the products they carry, changing the layout of the store and improving the overall customer experience. One important tactic is offering promotions or sales at the store. 

The decision of what promotions to offer need to be made frequently, usually at least from week to week. This decision impacts customer traffic (the number of customers who come to the supermarket) and the amount they spend once they are there. It is a decision that can be strategic and data-driven. 

We believe that supermarket managers want to offer targeted promotions. While "blanket promotions" such as 10% off all items will intice more customers to the store to shop more, there is a substantial decrease in profits due to the promotion. By understanding trends in customer traffic and spend by store, we want to equip managers with a tool to target promotions to specific stores, the day of the week, time of day, product lines, membership and even payment type. We propose building a dashboard that displays these trends, allowing managers to make decisions on store promotions.
